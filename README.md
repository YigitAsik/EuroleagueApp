# Euroleague Shiny App

This repo includes some of the source code for the [Euroleague Shiny App](https://hooplytics.shinyapps.io/EuroleagueApp/), app that provides *advanced statistics* and *visualizations* that are more informative than provided traditional metrics.

## Tabs

### xPTS (Expected Points)

Provides expected points per shot attempt for every player, which allows to quantify how well a person shots above expected (average) and extra points added.

### Hex-Shot Chart

This shot-chart quantifies the shot frequency with the size of the hexagons while colors express relative percentage versus the league average (position average, team average). With the selection of *On With* and/or *Without* features, you can restrict the plot to shots with certain players on the court and/or off the court.

### Possession Filter

This allows you to filter player stats based on *possession importance* (sometimes called *leverage*), which measures how much a possession can swing the winning probability.
